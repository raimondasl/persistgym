# Decisions log

Gate decisions, approvals and the numbers behind them (CLAUDE.md "Milestone and gate discipline"). Newest at the bottom. The researcher makes every go/no-go and spending call; Claude proposes.

## 2026-09-30: start $0 work; staged spending approvals
- **Decision (researcher):** amend PLAN.md (amendment A1) and start the $0 work of Stage 0 immediately. Inform the researcher at every major spending point for a decision.
- **Process (researcher):** all changes land through branches and pull requests; nothing is pushed directly to `main`.
- **Accounts (researcher, 2026-09-30):** ARC API key created. Gemini billing linked (usage tier to be checked in AI Studio). OpenAI org at usage tier 3 ($1,000/month usage limit).
- **Spend to date:** $0.
- **Next spending decision:** Stage 1-2 pilots (about $42-76; see PLAN.md §16 A1), requested only after `PREREG.md` is committed and payload snapshot tests pass.

## 2026-10-01: accounts ready; local ARC games; costs.csv schema
- **Accounts (researcher):** `.env` set up locally with the ARC, Google and OpenAI keys. Gemini billing account is at **Tier 2** ($2,000/month cap), so the Tier 1 $250 pause no longer applies.
- **Approved (researcher):** download the 25 public ARC-AGI-3 games once with the ARC key and run their game code locally, for $0 plumbing and payload tests only. Counted runs stay on ARC's online scorecard. Game sources stay under the gitignored `results/raw/`.
- **Approved (researcher):** add `service_tier_served`, `cache_write_tokens` and `latency_s` to `results/costs.csv` and the CLAUDE.md schema (no rows existed yet).
- **Merged:** PR #1 (scaffold), PR #2 (PLAN amendment A1), PR #3 (background facts).
- **Spend to date:** $0.
- **Merged (later on 2026-10-01):** PR #5 (ARC public-runs operational slice), PR #6 (cost model and power simulation), PR #9 (costs.csv schema). Researcher set provider-side spend limits (OpenAI project, Gemini project).

## 2026-10-01: ARC games downloaded; first $0 real-game runs; scoop signal
- **Games:** the 25 public ARC-AGI-3 games downloaded once with the ARC key (one request at a time, 3 s apart) at the exact versions of ARC's published Gemini 3.8 Flash runs (e.g. `lp85-305b61c3`). Stored under the gitignored `results/raw/arc_games/` with a SHA-256 manifest. Every game's `baseline_actions` equals the published sessions' `level_baseline_actions` (25 of 25).
- **Offline smoke on real games ($0):** the patched harness (PR #8, patches 0001-0015) played LS20 and TR87 under S0, S1, S2 and S4 with the stub model, fully offline: 8 of 8 runs pass the runner's request and `run_meta.json` checks. All ended `ACTION_BUDGET` (the stub plays seeded random actions). S1, S2 and S4 compacted (9 summaries on LS20, 19 on TR87); S0 never summarized. LS20 and TR87 were chosen because they are in neither the path pool nor any held-out candidate set, so no candidate game was played before the D14 decision. Output: `results/raw/arc_offline_smoke/`.
- **Scoop signal (kill criterion 6 check, not a trigger):** ARC Prize's harness repository has an unmerged branch `feature/continuous-conversation-carry-forward-ablation` whose last commit (fecf46b, 2026-08-29, "Add carry-forward prompt ablation") adds the notes sentence to the continuous-conversation (Adapter) system prompt. No PR was opened from it and no published scores were found (GitHub search and a web search on 2026-10-01). It would ablate one component (the notes instruction) on the Adapter side. Re-check at G0: ARC Prize blog and results pages, the repo's PRs and branches.
- **Spend to date:** $0.
